* https://github.com/jcwild/ADRIFT-5/[github.com/jcwild/ADRIFT-5^]

ADRIFT (Adventure Development & Runner -- Interactive Fiction Toolkit) is a GUI driven IF development system for Windows, allowing to create text adventures via dialog boxes and GUI controls instead of writing code. Supports graphics and sounds.

Developed by Campbell Wild since 1997, ADRIFT Developer (formerly called Adventure Generator) used to be a commercial product, then in 2011 it became freeware, and now the full source code is available on GitHub under BSD 3-Clause license.

There are different versions of ADRIFT, adventures created with a specific version of ADRIFT Developer should be played with the same version of ADRIFT Runner -- but ADRIFT Runner 5 should be able to run adventures created for v4:

* *ADRIFT 5.0* (2011–)
* *ADRIFT 4.0* (2002–2012)
* *ADRIFT 3.9* (2001)
* *ADRIFT 2.0* (aka Adventure Generator, 1997) -- legacy 16-bit DOS app

= Mappping Tools

Traditionally, IF maps are represented by boxes connected by lines, representing the various rooms and their directions connections. They are intended to represent movements in the adventure world locations, not a physical representation of its geography -- but sometimes «realistic» maps are provided with the game feelies, for aesthetic reasons.

Mapping tools can be used for either manually drawing maps from scratch, or to automatically build a map by analizying a game session transcript (live or saved). Some tools offer both functionality.

Many of the tools presented here are now hosted at the IF-Archive -- they are old and don't have any longer a website of their own. To avoid direct linking to their binary archives, a link to the "`Mapping Tools`" index page at IF-Archive will be provided instead:

== Story Files by Extensions

IF story files are distributed with different file extensions, depending on the IF authoring system used to create them and/or the output format the story has been compiled/converted to (in case of authoring systems that support multiple output formats, like Inform7, or when story files are converted from an old format to a newer one).

The following table resumes the most common story file extensions.

[cols="<10m,<90d",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| ext       | format
| .a3c      | <<Alan,Alan 3>> story file.

| .floydc   | Floyd story file.
| .gam      | <<TADS,TADS 2>> story file.

[cols="<10m,<90d",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| ext  | format
| .sav | Saved game file.
| .scr | Transcript of a Z-Code gameplay.
| .t3v | <<TADS,TADS 3>> saved game file.
|===============================================================================

== Virtual Machines

=== Z-machine

The Z-machine was the virtual machine used by Infocom for their text adventures (the '`Z`' stands for '`Zork`').
Originally developed in 1979 by Joel Berez and Marc Blank, it was later on decoded and reimplemented in the mid-1990s as an open standard by IF fans wishing to revive the genre and play the original Infocom adventures.

There are have been several variations of the Z-machine standard (z1 to z6), and present day IF interpreters support all of them for the sake of backward compatiblity.
The Inform compiler supports creating adventures in Z-machine format.
The Z-machine is a 16 bit virtual machine.
