= Mappping Tools

Traditionally, IF maps are represented by boxes connected by lines, representing the various rooms and their directions connections. They are intended to represent movements in the adventure world locations, not a physical representation of its geography -- but sometimes «realistic» maps are provided with the game feelies, for aesthetic reasons.

Mapping tools can be used for either manually drawing maps from scratch, or to automatically build a map by analizying a game session transcript (live or saved). Some tools offer both functionality.

Many of the tools presented here are now hosted at the IF-Archive -- they are old and don't have any longer a website of their own. To avoid direct linking to their binary archives, a link to the "`Mapping Tools`" index page at IF-Archive will be provided instead:
