== Files Extensions and Formats

For a full list of IF story files extensions, see:

* http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/List_of_file_extensions[IFWiki » List of file extensions^]
* http://ifdb.tads.org/fileformat[IFDB » File Formats^]

== Story Files by Extensions

IF story files are distributed with different file extensions, depending on the IF authoring system used to create them and/or the output format the story has been compiled/converted to (in case of authoring systems that support multiple output formats, like Inform7, or when story files are converted from an old format to a newer one).

The following table resumes the most common story file extensions.

== Source Files by Extensions

The following table resumes some common extensions used by IF authoring systems as source, headers or resource files. In some IF authoring systems, the source code file and the story file distributed for playing are one and the same.

[cols="<10m,<90d",options="header"]

| .a3r      | <<Alan,Alan 3>> multimedia resources file (same filename as its storyfile).

| .alr      | <<ADRIFT>> Language Resource file.
| .asl      | Quest source code and story file.
| .i6t      | <<Inform 6>> template used by <<Inform 7>> compiler.

[cols="<10m,<90d",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| ext  | format
| .sav | Saved game file.
| .scr | Transcript of a Z-Code gameplay.
| .t3v | <<TADS,TADS 3>> saved game file.

== Virtual Machines

=== Z-machine

The Z-machine was the virtual machine used by Infocom for their text adventures (the '`Z`' stands for '`Zork`').
Originally developed in 1979 by Joel Berez and Marc Blank, it was later on decoded and reimplemented in the mid-1990s as an open standard by IF fans wishing to revive the genre and play the original Infocom adventures.

There are have been several variations of the Z-machine standard (z1 to z6), and present day IF interpreters support all of them for the sake of backward compatiblity.
The Inform compiler supports creating adventures in Z-machine format.
The Z-machine is a 16 bit virtual machine.

=== Blorb

[quote, Blorb Specification]
____
[Blorb is] a formal specification for a common format for storing resources associated with an interactive fiction game file.
Resources are data which the game can invoke, such as sounds and pictures.
In addition, the executable game file may itself be a resource in a resource file. This is a convenient way to package a game and all its resources together in one file.
